# 2016 Presidential Candidate Tax Plan Comparison

This is a simple interactive table using jQuery that lets people compare different 2016 presidential candidates' tax plans. It's written with jade and sass, and compiled with harp. Because the Tax Foundation website is, as of writing this tool, running on Drupal, this tool is designed to be copy-pasted into a regular Drupal page. The styles, html, and javascript are all included together as the page content. Social sharing buttons are also included in this code because our Drupal pages don't (and shouldn't) include them by default. This is far from ideal, but it works.
